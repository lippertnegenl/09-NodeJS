09-NodeJS
Description:
this weeks homework was particularly interesting because it was the first week we got to use Node.  I can see the advantage of having an automatic README.md generator because in coding as well as the submission of forms on websites there is often alot of repetitiveness.  Having the ability to automatically generate a README based on somebody's answers to
various questions could save alot of time if we were recording the answers to a survey or other reason.

Note:  I am not going to include a screenshot of the generated README as it will be included in the video and in the repo.

below is a link to the repo
